# homework is a rubby application running on Kubernetes (minikube environment)
## Overview
This project is prepared for a special purpose. Main repository is on https://github.com/sawasy/http_server and forked to make changes on it.

The application is presented as a simple web service that returns a web page with the following message if you call with /healthcheck path:
```
OK
```

Otherwise returns w≈üth the following message
```
Well, hello there!
```

/healthcheck path is designed to use within liveness and rediness probes for containers.

## Assumptions
* Using similar environment written on documentation

## Prerequisites
* Usage of minkube

## Deploying the application
* Clone the git URL
* Verify minikube installation from the terminal
```

minikube service homework --url
```
* Connect the application  by using curl or any browser
```
url/healthcheck
url/anyother
```

* All the deployments can be deleted by using the following command

```
